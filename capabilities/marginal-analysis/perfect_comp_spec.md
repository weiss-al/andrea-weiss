# Marginal Analysis - Perfect Competition — model specification

## Purpose
Optimize planting of three crops for marginal cost across 64 beds for a perfectly competitive market. 

## Inputs — the named contract
| Name | Value | Unit | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `TOM_PRICE` | 8800 | USD per bed | Case scenario, crop table |
| `TOM_HRS`   | 2.5  | hours per week per bed | Case scenario, crop table |

Every input gets a name, a value, a unit, and a source. You choose the names.
The requirement is that they exist and are used consistently below.

## Structure
Each sheet or region, and what it is for.

## Calculation logic
In named-range notation, never cell addresses:

  LABOR_HRS(q) = q x HRS_PER_BED x WEEKS x (1 + DIM_PCT)^q

"Column D times column E" is not a specification — it describes a spreadsheet
that does not exist yet.

## Conventions
The rules that are not visible in the formulas: costing order, allocation basis,
rounding, what happens at the boundaries. State all of them. A convention you
leave out is a convention the builder invents.

## Validation rules
The conditions the finished artifact must satisfy — check figures as acceptance
criteria, hand calculations, and structural rules ("every calculated cell
contains a formula", "no error cells").

## Outputs
Each result the model reports, by name.

## Audit findings
Added AFTER the build. For each check: what you checked, what you found, what
you did about it.
